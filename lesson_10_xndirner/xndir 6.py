# Sum of Digits
# Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum
# of its digits. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).
# Use a while loop to perform this task.


x = int(input())

i = 0
a = 1

while i < a :
    i+=1
    print(x%10 + x//10)
